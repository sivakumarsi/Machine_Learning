Objective : To understand one way on analyzing stocks using quick and dirty Python Code

Summary : To start learning and analyzing stocks, we will start off by taking a quick look at the historical stocks prices. This will be done by extracting latest stocks data from pandas web-data reader and Yahoo Finance. Then we will try to view the data through exploratory analysis such as correlation heatmap, matplotlib visualization, and prediction analysis using Linear Analysis and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

Steps:

Step 1: Loading YahooFinance Dataset

#Pandas web data reader is an extension of pandas library to communicate with most updated financial data. This will include sources as: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Enigma, etc

i) Extract Apple stock data ( from 01-Jan-2010 till 01-Jan-2017)

import pandas as pd
import datetime
import pandas_datareader.data as web
from pandas import Series, DataFrame


start = datetime.datetime(2010, 1, 1)
end = datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 1)

df = web.DataReader("AAPL", 'yahoo', start, end)
df.tail()

For the rest of analysis, we will use the Closing Price which remarks the final price in which the stocks are traded by the end of the day.
